llm_engine/prompt_builder.py

Pure prompt-assembly functions for Axiom AI's LLM agents.

All functions in this module are stateless and side-effect-free.  They
take structured data and return list[LLMMessage] ready for any LLMBackend.

Three prompt families are provided:

  build_narrative_prompt  — Main gameplay turn (Arbitrator)
  build_chronicler_prompt — Off-screen world simulation (Chronicler)
  build_mini_dico_prompt  — Encyclopedic lore lookup (Mini-Dico)

Tool-Call Protocol Reminder
-----------------------------
The narrative prompt instructs the LLM to embed its state-change JSON inside
a  ~~~json … ~~~  fenced block (see llm_engine/base.py).
